## Data 606 - Capstone Project Proposal

## TEA LEAF DISEASE PREDICTION

### What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?

Tea is the world's second most consumed beverage, after only water. It's how I start my day, as well as my favorite drink. Tea plants have been suffering from a variety of diseases recently, including Red leaf spot, Algal leaf spot, Birds eyespot, Gray blight, and others.

### Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?

I'm working on a machine learning model to classify and predict tea plant disease in this project. This study can assist tea plant producers who do not have a lot of farming experience.

### Where do you get the data to analyze and help answer your questions (credibility of the source, quality of data, size of data, attributes of data. etc.)?

I'm training and testing my model on Kaggle data, and my source data is entirely image-based. I'd like to promote models that can provide more accuracy.

### What will be your unit of analysis (for example, patient, organization, or country)? Roughly how many units (observations) do you expect to analyze?

Red leaf spot, Algal leaf spot, Birds eyespot, Gray blight, White spot, Anthracnose, and Brown blight are among the tea plant diseases represented in the dataset. Along with these, there are some healthy tea plant leaf images as well. Each module has multiple images and enough data to train.

### What kinds of techniques/models do you plan to use (for example, clustering, NLP, ARIMA, etc.)?

To anticipate the tea plant disease, I wish to use image classification techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks, k-nearest neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and other advanced image classification approaches.

### What outcomes do you intend to achieve (better understanding of problems, tools to help solve problems, predictive analytics with practical applications, etc)?

I'll be utilizing machine learning models to predict tea plant disease in this project. Initially, I will classify the images depending on the plant disease and resize the images to the same size. Some python libraries, such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and machine learning libraries, will be used. In addition, I will create a user interface with Streamlit or other tools.
