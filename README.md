# Data 606 - Capstone Project

# A student Dropping Out And Educational Success Prediction

### Why I am interested to do this project: 

In my past, I have seen many of my friends drop out of college due to a lack of understanding of the importance of education, but I also witnessed many others who are brilliant and can understand any topic in a short period of time. 
I want to use this research to learn about and analyze the reasons for dropouts, as well as predict which students will drop out in the future. 
For example, if my model predicts that students in the journalism department will drop out at a higher rate, we can hold motivating sessions for journalism students to lower the dropout rate. Not only the department but there are also multiple features in my dataset, need to understand them and want to develop the model. 
In this project, I am going to use classification models (K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest) and want to try other classification models as well to predict the target variable.
I will use Jupyter Notebook to develop my code and use the libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and other machine learning libraries in python. Moreover, I want to maintain the complete code base and other information on GitHub.
